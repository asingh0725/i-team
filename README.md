## Mission Statement
Our goal here at Food security is to ensure that all people below the poverty line have access to a diverse range of nutritional needs in Seattle.

## Problem Statement
The Scope
In today’s society, the number of people experiencing hunger and food insecurity has been increasing even before the COVID-19 pandemic (United Nations Statistics Division, 2022). 
More specifically, food insecurity has taken a significant toll on the City of Seattle. 
According to the City of Seattle, Black, and Hispanic/Latinx households are twice as likely to experience food insecurity (26.6-32.4% between 2018-2020) than white households. 
In addition, Southeast Seattle households have high rates of food insecurity. The average rate for Southeast Seattle households between 2018 - 2020 was 26.5% (City of Seattle, n.d). 

## The impact on the effected people 
When individuals and families do not have enough healthy food it affects their health and wellbeing. 
According to Feeding America, food insecurity can make it difficult for a child to learn and grow. and can lead to difficult decisions like choosing between food, rent, bills, and transportation. 

## What causes food insecurity?
Food insecurity can be caused due to a variety of factors such as systemic issues. 
Structural racism makes BIPOC more vulnerable to food insecurity because of racism, higher rates of poverty, unstable housing, and barriers to assistance (City of Seattle, n.d). 
Disparities in income levels can lead to food insecurity. BIPOCs are more likely to make less in wages than their white colleagues (City of Seattle, n.d) 

## Existing Solutions 
There are many existing solutions created by the government and the Seattle community. 
The government offers SNAP benefits. Although it’s great that the government issues money to spend on food, individuals can not purchase hot foods or any food that will be eaten in the store (USDA Food and Nutrition Service, n.d). 
This creates a barrier because not everyone can access an equipped kitchen to cook a hot meal. 
Farestart is a program in Seattle that transforms lives, disrupts poverty, and nourishes communities through food, life skills, and job training (City of Seattle, n.d). 
The effectiveness of this program in addressing food insecurity may be limited as it may not be accessible to all people due to transportation barriers, preventing them from receiving a meal.
